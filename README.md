The "Color Matcher" project is a simple Java application that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated color. The user is presented with a color in RGB format (Red, Green, Blue), and they have to guess the correct combination of RGB values to match the displayed color.
The project is implemented using Java's console-based input/output for simplicity. It utilizes the Random class to generate random RGB values and the Scanner class to read user input. The program compares the user's guess with the actual color and provides feedback on each component's correctness. The guessing process continues until the user correctly identifies the color or chooses to quit the game."
